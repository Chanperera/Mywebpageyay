		 		<h2>About Plant Based</h2>
		 		<p align="text-center" >Hi, my name is Chandula and I am The Simple Veganista. I love creating healthy, affordable, easy vegan recipes that everyone will love and are worth repeating!
				I began a vegan lifestyle in the early part of 2011 and haven't looked back. Since then, I've become passionate about creating healthy vegan recipes some 100% raw vegan recipes, and sharing in hopes to inspire others.
				I started this vegan food blog in July of 2012 as a way to share my celebration of foods that are clean, nutrient dense as possible and take the focus off of animal products and processed foods.
				Vegan food is not boring, complicated or expensive. I share with you all the simple, beautiful plant foods there are to eat and the different ways to put them together that taste great!
				Eating a whole-foods plant based diet has truly become a joy. So whether you're eating vegan for health, the animals or just because, join me on this journey as I make my own creations as well as re-creating or veganizing worthwhile recipes!
